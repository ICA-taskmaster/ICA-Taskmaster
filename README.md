# üìú ICA-Taskmaster

The aim of this project is to develop a mission management system for ICA that will improve the organisation's operational efficiency and effectiveness. 
The system should enable ICA staff to manage their missions more efficiently, track their progress and communicate with other team members and high-volume customers in a secure and streamlined manner.

## üéØ Goals

* This project aims to improve the organisation's operational efficiency and effectiveness. Currently most of the administrative work is done manually.

* This project is designed with a microservices architecture to scale and manage the administrative post process of the entire Fontys organisation
  with over 10.000 personall. So this allows us to scale our software to support a large user base.

* To separate all concerns and keep the repositories SOLID each domain has been given each own codebase with its own repository.
  This is also to help maintain collaboration efficiently and opensource.
